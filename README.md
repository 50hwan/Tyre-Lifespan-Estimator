### What this is
![Network Training Progress](https://github.com/50hwan/Tyre-Lifespan-Estimator/assets/23158896/58139f02-6bc4-4d7d-b565-3f996301f18c)
- Train VGG-19 using the dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/warcoder/tyre-quality-classification)
  and make a (pretty damn good) binary classification of the tyres (good / defective) - **Section #0, #1**

- Make an inference of the network (need a little bit of modification on the code) - **Section #2**
  
![the rest section](https://github.com/50hwan/Tyre-Lifespan-Estimator/assets/23158896/8e9b8244-b4a0-4025-9364-23b0d1ce5d07)
- the rest sections of the code are for a different project; which i'm too lazy to modify or actually make that work
