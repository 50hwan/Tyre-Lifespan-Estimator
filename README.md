# Tyre-Lifespan-Estimator
### How To Use
- Download all files and run the .m file in MATLAB.
- This version is compatible with R2017b or higher.


### What this is
- Train VGG-19 using the dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/warcoder/tyre-quality-classification)
  and make a (pretty damn good) binary classification of the tyres (good / defective) - Section #1-2
- Make an inference of the network (need a little bit of modification on the code) - Section #3
- Plot the datapoints; each point includes the data : Tire main grooves, AI scores based on the classification result

- the rest sections of the code are for different projects; which i'm too lazy to modify or actually make that work
