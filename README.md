# Tyre-Lifespan-Estimator
### How To Use
- Download all files and run the .m file in MATLAB.
- This version is compatible with R2017b or higher.


### What this is
- Train VGG-19 using the dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/warcoder/tyre-quality-classification)
  and make a (pretty damn good) binary classification of the tyres (good / defective) - **Section #0, #1**
  - ![Network Training Progress](https://github.com/50hwan/Tyre-Lifespan-Estimator/assets/23158896/58139f02-6bc4-4d7d-b565-3f996301f18c)

- Make an inference of the network (need a little bit of modification on the code) - **Section #2**
  

- the rest sections of the code are for a different project,
- with this : https://github.com/podopie12/code_upload/tree/master

- which i'm too lazy to modify or actually make that work
- and this is the result of that
